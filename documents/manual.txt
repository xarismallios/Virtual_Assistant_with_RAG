Installation Instructions

To install the washing machine, ensure it is placed on a flat, stable surface. Use a leveling tool to adjust the feet for balance. Connect the water inlet hose to a clean, cold water supply and ensure the hose is firmly tightened to prevent leaks. The drain hose should be positioned securely in the drainage pipe, at least 60 cm above the floor level. Plug the washing machine into a grounded electrical outlet, ensuring the voltage matches the appliance's requirements.

Operating Modes

The washing machine offers multiple washing modes tailored to various fabrics and levels of dirtiness. The 'Quick Wash' mode cleans lightly soiled clothes within 30 minutes using minimal water and energy. The 'Cotton' mode provides a thorough clean for durable fabrics like cotton towels and bedding. For delicate items such as silk and lace, select the 'Delicates' mode, which uses a gentle drum motion to avoid damage. The 'Heavy Duty' mode is ideal for heavily soiled clothes, offering extended washing cycles with higher water temperatures.

Energy Consumption

This washing machine is designed for energy efficiency, consuming 0.8 kWh of power and approximately 50 liters of water per standard cycle. The machine is certified with an A+++ energy rating, making it an eco-friendly choice for households. By using the 'Eco Wash' setting, users can further reduce energy consumption by 15%, although the cycle duration may increase to optimize water heating efficiency.

Troubleshooting

If you notice water leaking from the washing machine, check the following steps: 1) Ensure the water inlet hose is securely connected and not damaged. 2) Verify that the drain hose is correctly positioned and not blocked. 3) Inspect the door seal for any tears or debris preventing a tight seal. 4) Avoid overloading the drum, as excessive weight may cause water to escape during operation. If the issue persists, consult the service manual or contact customer support.

Cleaning the Filter

To maintain optimal performance, clean the filter every month. Start by turning off the washing machine and unplugging it for safety. Open the bottom access panel to locate the filter. Carefully unscrew the filter cap and pull it out. Rinse the filter thoroughly under running water to remove lint, coins, and debris. Wipe the filter cavity clean with a cloth and reinsert the filter securely before closing the panel. Always check for leaks after cleaning the filter.

Q&A (Frequently Asked Questions)
Q: What should I do if the washing machine doesn’t start?
"Ensure the washing machine is plugged into a working outlet and the power switch is turned on. Check if the door is securely closed, as the machine won’t start if the door is ajar. Additionally, verify that the water supply valves are open, and there’s no error message displayed on the control panel. If the issue persists, consult the troubleshooting section in the manual."
Q: How do I remove unpleasant odors from the drum?
"To eliminate odors, run a cleaning cycle with an empty drum using hot water and 1 cup of white vinegar or a specialized drum cleaner. Leave the door open between washes to allow airflow and prevent moisture buildup. Regularly clean the filter and door seal to avoid mold and mildew formation."

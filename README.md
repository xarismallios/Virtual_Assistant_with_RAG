ðŸ¤–  **AI Virtual Assistant using RAG** provides a cutting-edge, production-ready solution for answering users questions, based on our latest documentation and user manuals. Users chat with our data !


We are an e-commerce brand specializing in selling washing machines. Our customers often seek information about our products, but traditional LLMs like ChatGPT lack access to accurate and up-to-date details. However, we have access to a wealth of relevant resources, including manufacturer manuals, customer reviews, and a collection of past Q&A topics compiled from our customer support system. To bridge this gap, we utilize a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to retrieve these documents and enrich our knowledge base, ensuring more relevant and precise responses to user queries.


Below you will find the relevant architecture
